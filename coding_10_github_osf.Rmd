# GitHub

# Open Science Framework

The Open Science Framework (OSF) plays a role that GitHub can not.

You can register projects. Registered projects can't be altered anymore. This guarantees to your readers that you didn't tamper with data files or code after publication.

You can also get a DOI for your data and code so that you can always show that you did something first.
